					<russia><h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI), the study of the simulation of intelligent behaviors, has recently been researched more in depth and widely known in the 21st century. Although AI is only a recent field, the study of AI dates back to 1941 when the first computer was made by a German scientist Konrad Zuse. This first discovery of AI was used only for aerodynamic calculations and had a 22 bit word limit. From this discovery, incredible advances has been made including the ground breaking 1975 ‚ÄúAlto‚Äù computer with an user interface and advanced printing mechanism and has been continually refined to what most notably known today to the public in the form of Apple‚Äôs iPhones and Amazon‚Äôs Alexa.

							The term ‚ÄúArtificial intelligence‚Äù comes from John McCarthy in  a 1956 conference as the study of implementing humanesque behaviors, mind, and actions into technology.
							In 1959, Arthur Samuel, working at IBM, made the first ‚Äúlearning machine.‚Äù
							This machine was programmed to play checkers against high level players and improved it‚Äôs play style over past experiences.
							This revolutionized the creation of later AI using his method of an autonomic and self learning computer machine.
							Two studies in 1963 and 1964 by Evans and Bobrow displayed that machines could solve highly complex math problems and understand the human language.
							These ideas of AI were the core learning aspects behind the technology of it.
							The first major use of AI that humans couldn't do was shown by Nasa‚Äôs Pathfinder Mission in 1996 where Nasa‚Äôs Pathfinder was successfully launched and landed on the surface of Mars.</h4>

							In the early 2000s, the use of AIs in smart toys were first fully realized and sold to the public.
							This created the realization of using AI in everyday life for mass public consumption and sparked the interest of AI helping humans in tasks not able to be achieved by human activity.

This first discovery of AI was used only for aerodynamic calculations and had a 22 bit word limit. From this discovery, incredible advances has been made including the ground breaking 1975 ‚ÄúAlto‚Äù computer with an user interface and advanced printing mechanism and has been continually refined to what most notably known today to the public in the form of Apple‚Äôs iPhones and Amazon‚Äôs Alexa. <br><br> The term ‚ÄúArtificial intelligence‚Äù comes from John McCarthy in a 1956 conference as the study of implementing humanesque behaviors, mind, and actions into technology. In 1959, Arthur Samuel, working at IBM, made the first ‚Äúlearning machine.‚Äù This machine was programmed to play checkers against high level players and improved it‚Äôs play style over past experiences. This revolutionized the creation of later AI using his method of an autonomic and self learning computer machine. Two studies in 1963 and 1964 by Evans and Bobrow displayed that machines could solve highly complex math problems and understand the human language. These ideas of AI were the core learning aspects behind the technology of it. The first major use of AI that humans couldn\'t do was shown by Nasa‚Äôs Pathfinder Mission in 1996 where Nasa‚Äôs Pathfinder was successfully launched and landed on the surface of Mars. In the early 2000s, the use of AIs in smart toys were first fully realized and sold to the public. This created the realization of using AI in everyday life for mass public consumption and sparked the interest of AI helping humans in tasks not able to be achieved by human activity.</h4>');
